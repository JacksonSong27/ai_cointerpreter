# Ask My Body - Design System Guidelines

## Project Overview
AI-powered health companion app that integrates with Apple Health data for research study Protocol A-H. Emphasizes self-compassion, flexible goals (budgets not targets), and reframes health deviations as insights rather than failures.

## Visual Style
Minimal, modern, soft health tech aesthetic focused on calm and compassion.

## Color Palette

### Primary Colors
- **Blue #0A84FF** - Primary accent for actions, data visualization, active states
- **Mint #7DD4B0** - Secondary accent for success, calm highlights, sleep-related metrics

### Neutrals
- **Background #F7FAFC** - Soft mist background for the entire app
- **Cards #FFFFFF** - Pure white cards with soft shadows
- **Text #2C3639** - Charcoal for primary text
- **Muted Text #6B7280** - For secondary information

### Color Behavior by Screen
| Screen | Accent Color | Meaning |
|--------|-------------|---------|
| Home | Blue+Mint small | Neutral pivot |
| Morning | Blue primary | Motivation |
| Evening | Mint accents | Compassion + learning |
| Chat | Mostly neutrals | Focus on messages |
| Weekly Digest | Mint highlights | Wins and patterns |
| Weekly Goals | Blue actions | Setting fresh intentions |

**Rule**: One accent focus per screen ‚Üí reduces cognitive overload

### Usage Guidelines
- Use Blue (#0A84FF) for: Steps, activity, primary buttons, interactive elements
- Use Mint (#7DD4B0) for: Sleep, mindfulness, success states, gentle highlights
- Avoid harsh reds or warning colors - use softer amber (#F59E0B) if needed
- Gradients should be subtle: `linear-gradient(135deg, rgba(10, 132, 255, 0.05) 0%, rgba(125, 212, 176, 0.05) 100%)`

## Typography
- System fonts: `-apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', 'Roboto'`
- Font smoothing enabled for clarity
- Calm, readable hierarchy

## Components
- **Rounded Corners**: 0.75rem (12px) for cards and buttons
- **Soft Shadows**: `0 1px 3px 0 rgba(44, 54, 57, 0.05)`
- **Icon Backgrounds**: Use colored backgrounds with 10-15% opacity
- **Borders**: Very subtle `rgba(44, 54, 57, 0.08)`

## Tone & Voice
- Empathetic and non-judgmental
- Friendly wellness coach rather than medical authority
- Celebrate small wins, frame deviations as insights
- Use playful language ("forecast game", "curiosity", "patterns")
- Self-compassion reminders throughout

## Daily Interaction Cycle

Every day has **2 required actions**:
1. **Morning** ‚Äî Set Today's Intention
2. **Evening** ‚Äî Reflect on Today

Chat is **optional anytime**.

### üè† Home Screen (Daily Anchor)

**Shows only ONE task at a time**, based on what's done:

- If morning incomplete ‚Üí button: **"Set Today's Intention"**

## Goal Communication & Behavior

The app uses specific language to communicate the relationship between weekly goals and daily intentions, ensuring users always feel supported.

### How the App Should Communicate This

**Weekly goal screen:**
> "This is your flexible weekly target. You can reach it in different ways each day."

**Daily morning screen:**
> "Today's intention helps you move toward your weekly goal."

**Weekly digest:**
> "You hit your goal on 4 days ‚Äî success!"

The language ensures users always feel supported.

### What Happens in the UI

| Behavior | Weekly Affects Daily | Daily Affects Weekly |
|----------|---------------------|---------------------|
| Setting goals | Daily slider auto-suggestions stay realistic | Mint "‚úì day completed" dots |
| Progress display | Show "2 of 4 days completed" | Weekly digest evaluation |
| Motivation | Future-focused ("You got this") | Learning-focused ("See pattern") |

**No judgment. No strict fail states. Just pattern awareness.**

### Simple Math Logic (Backend)

**Weekly Goal Example: Sleep average = 7 hours**

Daily contributes:
```
Weekly Sleep Average = (sum of each day's sleep) / 7
```

**Weekly Goal Example: Steps goal = 4 days**

Daily contributes:
```
If Daily Steps >= Daily Goal ‚Üí Mark as Goal Day ‚úÖ
Else ‚Üí Neutral, not a failure
```

**Evening Reflection Scoring:**

*Calibration Points (0-100 scale):*
- Measures prediction accuracy across both steps and sleep
- Formula: `100 - error_percentage` for each metric, then averaged
- Example: If forecast was 7000 steps and actual was 8100 steps:
  - Error = |8100 - 7000| / 7000 = 15.7%
  - Calibration = 100 - 15.7 = 84.3 points
- Higher score = more accurate prediction

*Surprise Index (0-100%):*
- Shows combined deviation from predictions
- Average of percentage errors from both metrics
- Higher number = more unexpected outcomes
- Example: 15.7% steps error + 2% sleep error = ~9% surprise index

*Dynamic Interpretation:*
- ‚â•85 calibration: "Excellent forecast"
- ‚â•70 calibration: "Pretty good sync"
- ‚â•30% surprise: "Life threw some surprises"
- Otherwise: "Your body had different plans"

## What Stays Editable vs Locked

| Screen | Editable? | Why |
|--------|-----------|-----|
| Login | ‚úÖ | Correction allowed |
| Weekly Goals | ‚úÖ until next week starts | Flexibility mindset |
| Morning Intention | ‚ùå after submit | Avoid cheating |
| Evening Reflection | ‚ùå after submit | Maintain fidelity |
| Chat | Always open | Learning & curiosity |
| Weekly Digest | View only | Preserve report integrity |

‚úÖ This maintains honest behavior and clean research data.

## What Happens if User Skips a Step?

| Scenario | App Response |
|----------|--------------|
| Skips morning intention | Evening asks intention first OR default prediction auto-applied |
| Skips reflection | Reminder card appears next morning |
| Misses multiple days | App enters "gentle recovery mode" (resume today) |
| Joins mid-week | Week count continues normally |

‚úÖ Always supportive, never punitive
